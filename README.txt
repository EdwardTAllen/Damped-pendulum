README

This project deoted by 'Damped Pendulum' is a simulation of a simple damped
pendulum which is affected by the acceleration due to gravity. This project
can be used to model how a damped pendulum would behave under different
damping coditions. It also can simulate this for multiple pendulums all with
different mass values and lengths of taught string.

FILES CONTAINED

The files you will find contained in here are as follows: main, which is 
where the main loop of the program is run to generate the data, plotting_methods,
which provides a plotting class to plot this data, pendulum, which is a class
producing all the pendulum objects and there are two files for different types
of plots that can be produced; energy and position plots
